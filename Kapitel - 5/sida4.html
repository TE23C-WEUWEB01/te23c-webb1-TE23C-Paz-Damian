        <p>Christopher George Latore Wallace (May 21, 1972 - March 9, 1997), known by the stage names the Notorious B.I.G., Biggie Smalls,
             and Biggie, was an American rapper. Rooted in the New York rap scene and gangsta rap traditions,
             he is widely considered one of the greatest rappers of all time. </p>
        <p>Wallace became known for his distinctive, laidback lyrical delivery, 
            offsetting his lyrics' often grim content. His music was usually semi-autobiographical, 
            telling of hardship and criminality but also of debauchery and celebration.</p>
