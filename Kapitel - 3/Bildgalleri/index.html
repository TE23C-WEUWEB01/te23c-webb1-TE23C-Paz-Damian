            <p>AS11-40-5878 (20 July 1969) --- A close-up view of an astronaut's bootprint 
                in the lunar soil, photographed with a 70mm lunar surface camera during the 
                Apollo 11 extravehicular activity (EVA) on the moon. While astronauts Neil A. 
                Armstrong, commander, and Edwin E. Aldrin Jr., lunar module pilot, descended in
                 the Lunar Module (LM) "Eagle" to explore the Sea of Tranquility region of the 
                 moon, astronaut Michael Collins, command module pilot, remained 
                with the Command and Service Modules (CSM) "Columbia" in lunar orbit.</p>

            <h3>Earth moon</h3>
            <p>NASA's Galileo spacecraft took this image of Earth's Moon on Dec. 7, 1992, on 
                its way to explore the Jupiter system in 1995-97. The distinct bright 
                ray crater at the bottom of the image is the Tycho impact basin.</p>

            <h3>2017 Total Solar Eclipse </h3>
            <p>The Moon is seen passing in front of the Sun during a total solar 
                eclipse on Monday, August 21, 2017 from onboard a NASA Gulfstream III 
                aircraft flying 25,000 feet above the Oregon coast. A total solar eclipse 
                swept across a narrow portion of the contiguous United States from Lincoln
                 Beach, Oregon to Charleston, South Carolina. A partial solar eclipse was 
                 visible across the entire North American continent along with parts of 
                 South America, 
                Africa, and Europe. Photo Credit: (NASA/Carla Thomas)</p>
